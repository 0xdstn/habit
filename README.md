# ðŸ“Š Habits

This is a simple tool to track habits.

This is meant to be a weekly tool and doesn't keep history.

In the settings you provide a comma separated list of emoji, each of which represent a habit you want to track.

This site is a PWA, meaning you can install it to your device in Android and it will look and act like a native application.
